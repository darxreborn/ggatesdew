Hey reader!

I’m @ggatesdew (aka. Darx)

I’m interested in network infrastructure, IoT, virtualization, and the list goes on...

I’m currently learning how to set up a Load Balancer and set-up SSL certificates (with the help of Let's Encrypt and Cloudflare)

I’m looking to collaborate on projects like OpenWRT

How to reach me? Discord: Darx#1215
